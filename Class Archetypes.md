# Arknights Class Archetypes
While operators in Arknights are divided up into one of eight basic classes, each of those classes has units that share certain similarities, and can be seen as members of a specific subclass or 'archetype'. Understanding these archetypes can assist in making good faith comparisons between units and choosing units that will work well for your playstyle and the demands of the content you're assembling a team for. 

### **!!THIS IS NOT A TIER LIST!!**
Units in this list are sorted by rarity, not efficacy. While higher rarity units will have higher statlines, they're very rarely direct upgrades over a given lower rarity unit within the same core archetype.

### Vanguard
As a class, vanguard units are intended to be your initial melee operators, holding the frontline as you build the DP required to drop stronger units. They have low cost and nearly all of them have abilities revolving around DP generation or manipulation.

 - **Standard Vanguards**</br>
 The baseline Vanguard archetype, also referred to as 'DP regen' or 'DP over time' vanguards. These operators can block 2 enemies units and (with the exception of Yato) generate DP through skills. This archetype can be further split into offensive and defensive variants, but this differentiation doesn't radically alter playstyle.
 
 - **Aggro Vanguards**</br>
 Compared to standard vanguards, these operators have significantly higher damage output, but can only block 1 unit by default. Defining features of their archetype include generating DP through securing kills and fully refunding DP cost when manually retreated. Due to their method of DP generation, aggro vanguards are generally better suited to a more aggressive playstyle, dropping them away from other operators in order to prevent killstealing. Their low cost and strong damage output allows them to be repurposed later in fights as extra damage dealers.
 
 - **Healing Vanguards**</br>
 Vanguard operators with healing skills. They only have 1 block while also lacking in offensive throughput, but compensate with very high DP generation and the ability to heal allied units.
 
 - **Siege**</br>
 Siege has the statline of a standard vanguard, and her first skill is the exact same passive DP gen skill as the 5\* standard vanguards. However, her second skill, especially when paired with her E2 talent, forces her to be used in a more aggressive manner. Instead of generating DP passively, her second skill is an auto-trigger AoE nuke that generates a small amount of DP with a very fast recharge time. Because DP is gained when the skill is triggered, she doesn't need to secure kills like the aggro vanguards and is therefore less prone to killstealing, but because her skill will only trigger when an enemy enters range, she does need to be on the frontline and have enemies actively reaching her in order for her to function as a DP engine.
 
### Sniper
Snipers are your primary physical damage ranged operators. Fairly self-explanatory class.

 - **Fast Snipers**</br>
 The baseline sniper archetype. Fast snipers have very low cost and fast attack speed, making them useful drops early in a map alongside your vanguards. They also prioritise attacking air units.
 
 - **AoE Snipers**</br>
 High cost and slow attack speed, but their attacks deal splash damage. Longer range than fast snipers.
 
 - **Precision Snipers**</br>
 Moderate cost damage dealers with high attack, moderately slow attack speed, and short range. Deal increased damage to close enemies. Generally used to deal with bosses and other tanky enemies.
 
 - **Long-Range Snipers**</br>
 Very high attack, very slow attack speed, moderate cost, very long range. Their long range allows them to take down threats from a more safe distance, and their attack lets them punch through armour more readily than fast snipers, althought their traits force them to target lowest defence enemies first.
 
 - **Shotgun Snipers**</br>
 Very high cost, moderately slow attack speed, and very short range. Something of a hybrid between precision and AoE snipers.

### Medic
Medics are your primary healing operators. While healers can be found in other classes, most of them can't match the throughput of a dedicated medic. However, medics don't attack enemies.

 - **Single-Target Medics**</br>
 Baseline medic archetype. High attack (healing potency is tied to the healing operator's attack stat), but can only heal 1 target at a time by default.
 
 - **AoE Medics**</br>
 Low attack and cost. Heals multiple operators at once. Their range covers the same total no. tiles as ST medics, but is shifted back by 1 tile, allowing AoE medics to heal operators behind them.
 
 - **Long-Range Medics**</br>
 Large base range and can heal distant targets with reduced potency. Moderately high cost with attack stats roughly between ST and AoE medics.

### Caster
Arts damage counterpart to the physical damage of snipers. In general, casters have higher DP cost and shorter range, but arts damage bypasses defence, checking magic resistance instead, allowing casters to punch through more heavily armoured enemies more readily than most snipers.

 - **Single-Target Casters**</br>
 ST casters have moderate cost and average range. Could be considered the 'baseline' archetype, but isn't any more common than AoE casters.
 
 - **AoE Casters**</br>
 Low range, high attack, very slow attack speed, and very high cost. Attacks deal splash damage.
 
 - **Leizi**</br>
 Moderately low attack, slow attack speed, very high cost. Her attacks bounce between enemies like a 'chain lightning' effect making her a pseudo-AoE caster. Attacks slow enemies hit.

### Guard
Catch-all for melee damage dealer archetypes that don't fit in the other classes.

 - **Duelists**</br>
 1 block units with high attack and relatively high base bulk, often with survival-boosting elements in their kit. These operators are built around 1v1 'duels' with enemy units, and are often used as assassin-type units, but can be very potent permanent damage dealers.
 
 - **Brawlers**</br>
 Low attack, very fast attack speed, very low cost fistfighters. Capable of putting out very high amounts of damage, but dealing damage through fast attacks with low power means they struggle against enemies with even moderate amounts of armour without assistance. Their low cost makes them effective 'panic button' units that can be dropped to deal with enemies that leak through your defensive line or as more aggressive damage dealers dropped early in a map.
 
 - **Dual-strike Guards**</br>
 Low attack, but basic attacks hit twice, block 2 units. Fencing and iaidou themed with fast-striking skills. Can be considered a more defensive counterpart to brawlers.
 
 - **AoE Guards**</br>
 Attack enemies equal to block count, block 2 units at base and 3 with E2 promotion, high cost.
 
 - **Ranged Guards**</br>
 Very large range and can block 2 units. Attacks at range deal reduced damage, but can also hit air units. Very flexible archetype whose range allows them to be placed behind your frontline or on melee tiles standard-range melee operators would be incapable of utilising.
 
 - **Arts Guards**</br>
 Attacks deal arts damage on a permanent basis, bypassing enemy defence in favour of checking magic resistance.
 
 - **Field Support Guards**</br>
 Increased range and moderately low cost, can block 2 units. Field support guards have talents that provide permanent buffs to nearby allies that meet their buff criteria. Generally lower damage output than other guard archetypes, but their increased range allows them to be placed behind defensive lines, similar to ranged guards.
 
 - **Hellagur**</br>
 Can't be healed by allied operators, but has self-healing abilities. His second skill is an incredibly potent defensive buff, and his third skill gives him increased range and AoE attacks.
 - **Castle-3**</br>
 Support robot. While he has the support tag and a talent that provides an attack buff to allies when he's deployed, Castle lacks the other defining factors of field support guards.

### Defender
More defensive melee units. Typically high cost and low damage, but very hard to kill. Most defenders have a 1x1 range, in contrast to the standard 1x2 range of other melee units, meaning they can only attack enemies they're actively blocking.

 - **Standard Defenders**</br>
 Baseline defender archetype. Strong defensive stats and can block 3 units.
 
 - **Offensive Standard Defenders**</br>
 Minor variation on the standard archetype defined by having increased range and slightly increased attack. While the statlines are still within the margins you would expect from a standard defender, the increased range has a profound impact on playstyle, especially when paired with other operators capable of inflicting slow debuffs. Liskarm is also noteworthy in that her attacks deal ranged damage and can therefore hit air units.
 
 - **Healing Defenders**</br>
 Generally weaker defensive statlines than standard defenders, but can heal allied operators. Only block 2 units at base, but block 3 at E1 promotion.
 
 - **Nian**</br>
 High base attack but slightly reduced attack speed. Has support oriented abilities. Especially noteworthy for her ability to increase the block stat of nearby allies with her third skill.
 - **Vulcan**</br>
 Very high cost, very high base attack, can't be healed by allied operators. Her second skill reduces her block count to 2 and attack speed, but causes her attacks to deal damage to enemies equal to block count.
 - **Dur-Nar**</br>
 Moderately high attack, moderately slow attack speed, attacks deal arts damage while her skills are active.

### Supporter
 Arts damage ranged operators focused less on dealing damage and more on providing support effects to the rest of the team compared to casters. Generally low cost and long range.
 
 - **Slow Supporters**</br>
 The most common supporter archetype. Attacks inflict slow debuff on any enemy hit. Generally have skills that either increase attack speed or provide AoE effects, both of which assist in their role of keeping enemies locked down. Serve a sort of 'time dilation' role, with the slow debuff increasing the effective range of themselves and any allies able to hit a slowed enemy, which can ease the pressure of DPS or tanking checks.
 
 - **Summoners**</br>
 Can summon minions. Stats of summoned minions are tied to the operator's stats, and summoned minions do take up deployment slots. High-level summoners can functionally solo many maps, making summoners useful operators for trust farming.
 
 - **Pramanix**</br>
 Low cost, very large range. Her abilities increase the damage taken by enemies within her range.
 
 - **Sora**</br>
 Very low cost, short range, high defence. Doesn't attack, but slowly heals allies in range and has strong damage support abilities.

### Specialist
Catch-all class for 'unique' unit types that don't readily fit into other classes.

 - **Shift Specialists - Push**</br>
 Can be placed on high and low-ground tiles and have abilities for pushing enemies. Melee range and attacks, and can attack units equal to block count, block 2 units at base.
 
 - **Shift Specialists - Pull**</br>
 Can be placed on high and low-ground tiles and have abilities for pulling enemies. Ranged attacks and increased attack range.
 
 - **Fast Redeploy Specialists**</br>
 Very fast redeploy timers and very low cost, with skills that trigger on deployment.
 
 - **Stealth Specialists**</br>
 0 block low-ground units. Attack all enemies within attack range and have crowd control abilities. They have 50% dodge against all damage sources and have reduced targeting priority, which makes them functionally invulnerable to ranged attacks and outright immune to melee enemies thanks to having 0 block.
 
 - **Aak**</br>
 Something of a cross between a sniper and a supporter. Very similar statline to a fast sniper. His second and third skills deal very high damage to an ally, but provide both himself and that ally (should they survive) with a very strong buff.
